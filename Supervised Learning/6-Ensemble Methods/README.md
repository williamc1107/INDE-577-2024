# Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning

## Introduction

In this Jupyter notebook, we delve into Ensemble Methods, which combine multiple models to bolster predictive accuracy in machine learning. Specifically, we'll be exploring Bagging and Random Forest techniques, applied to the California housing dataset.

## Ensemble Methods Overview

Ensemble methods leverage the power of multiple machine learning models to create a more accurate and robust predictive system. We will focus on two types:

### Bagging
Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, works by training multiple independent models on different subsets of the data. The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all models for regression tasks or by majority voting for classification tasks.

#### Advantages:
- Reduces variance and overfitting.
- Improves model stability and accuracy.
- Simple to implement with parallel training capabilities.

#### Disadvantages:
- Bias remains largely unaffected.
- Model complexity can increase with the number of estimators.
- Managing a large ensemble can be computationally expensive.

### Random Forest
A Random Forest is an extension of Bagging, applied to decision tree models. It creates a forest of trees where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features, resulting in high-performing and diversified models.

#### Advantages:
- Often delivers high performance with minimal tuning.
- Naturally performs feature selection, providing insights into feature importance.
- Can be trained in parallel for large datasets.

#### Disadvantages:
- More complex than individual decision trees, leading to less interpretability.
- Slower predictions due to the aggregation of multiple trees.

## Implementation

Using the California housing dataset, we will implement Bagging and Random Forest regressors to predict housing prices. This dataset is rich with features such as median income, housing age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, average occupancy, latitude, and longitude, all of which influence the median house value in a district.

### Bagging
We will use a Bagging regressor with decision trees as the base learner to predict the median house value.

### Random Forest
We will also employ a Random Forest regressor to predict the same target variable, taking advantage of its inherent feature selection capabilities to possibly improve upon the Bagging regressor's performance.

## Conclusion

Our exploration into Bagging and Random Forest regressors with the California housing dataset aims to highlight the strengths and practical applications of ensemble methods. By comparing the performance of these methods, we will assess their viability for real-world regression tasks such as housing price prediction, acknowledging their advantages in accuracy and robustness against the trade-offs in complexity and interpretability.
