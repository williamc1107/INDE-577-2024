# The Perceptron - A Classic Approach to Binary Classification

## Introduction
This project presents a thorough examination of the Perceptron, a classical linear binary classifier that's renowned for its effectiveness in clear-cut, linearly separable scenarios. Its simplicity is deceptive, as it lays the groundwork for understanding more complex machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset and Problem Statement
In our study, we employ the Perceptron to the famous Titanic dataset, which encapsulates the fateful journey of the Titanic passengers. Our task is to predict a binary outcome: did a passenger survive or not, based on features such as passenger class, sex, age, and ticket fare.

## Problem Simplification
We streamline the problem to binary classification, aligning perfectly with the Perceptron's capabilities. By focusing on features with the highest predictive power, we simplify our analysis without sacrificing the integrity of our model's predictive potential.

## Implementation
Our accompanying Jupyter notebook walks you through the essential steps:
- **Data Preprocessing**: We start by loading the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones suitable for model ingestion.
- **Binary Classification Adaptation**: The Titanic dataset is adapted for binary classification, with 'survival' as the target variable.
- **Feature Selection**: We judiciously select features that contribute most significantly to a passenger's chance of survival.
- **Data Division**: We divide the data into training and testing subsets, ensuring our model can be both trained and validated effectively.
- **Perceptron Modeling**: The model is then constructed with methods for training on the dataset and making predictions.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: After training, we assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and present a confusion matrix to evaluate its predictive performance.
- **Visualization**: To aid in interpretation, we provide visualizations such as a confusion matrix and a precision-recall curve, offering a clear view of the model's performance.

## Conclusion
The application of the Perceptron to the Titanic dataset not only highlights the model's strengths but also its limitations. While the model achieves a reasonable accuracy of 75.4%, the visualizations and metrics reveal areas for improvement, particularly in reducing false positives. This project serves as a practical guide for those new to machine learning, illustrating the process from data preparation to model evaluation, with clear insights into the workings of an elementary yet instructive algorithm.
