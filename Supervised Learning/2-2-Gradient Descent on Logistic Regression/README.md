# Gradient Descent - Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset

## Introduction
In this project, we apply logistic regression, facilitated by gradient descent, to the historical Titanic dataset. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary classification tasks such as predicting survival outcomes from disaster data.

## Algorithm Overview
The logistic regression model is adapted to determine survival probabilities based on passenger features like ticket class, gender, and age. Key steps in the process include:

- **Model Definition**: Predicting survival as a binary outcome with logistic function probabilities.
- **Cost Function**: Binary cross-entropy loss measures the prediction accuracy.
- **Gradient Descent**: An iterative optimization algorithm that updates model parameters to minimize the loss.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Determine the direction and magnitude of the parameter updates.
- **Parameter Update**: Adjust parameters against the gradient, using a learning rate to converge to the best solution.
- **Prediction**: The final model predicts survival based on the logistic probability curve.

Despite its robustness, logistic regression can be sensitive to feature scaling and outliers, assuming a linear decision boundary.

## Implementation
We confront the Titanic dataset with logistic regression to predict passenger survival:

- **Loading Dataset**: Data is preprocessed, with missing values imputed and categorical features encoded.
- **Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression**: We implement the model using an iterative approach to refine the prediction of survival.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is measured by its classification accuracy and the insightfulness of the generated confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
The logistic regression model offers a meaningful baseline for predicting survival on the Titanic. It serves as an insightful tool for understanding the factors that influenced passenger survival. To enhance the model, we could explore additional features, alternative data preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.

This project underscores the value of logistic regression in binary classification and the power of gradient descent for efficient optimization. It's a testament to how historical data can inform machine learning applications, providing both technical learning and historical insight.

We encourage further exploration and fine-tuning of the logistic regression model to uncover deeper patterns and potentially improve predictive performance.
