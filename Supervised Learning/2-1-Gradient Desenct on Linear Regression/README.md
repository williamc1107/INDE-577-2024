# Gradient Descent - Linear Regression

## Introduction
Welcome to the Gradient Descent - Linear Regression project! This Jupyter notebook explores the use of the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm in the context of linear regression. Known for its efficiency and scalability, Gradient Descent is crucial for optimizing regression models that predict continuous variables from a set of predictor variables.

## Dataset and Problem Statement
The California Housing dataset, compiled from the 1990 California census, provides comprehensive data on housing prices across different districts of California. It includes features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms per household, average number of bedrooms per household, population, average occupancy, latitude, and longitude. These features are predictors of the median housing price in a given block, making this dataset ideal for regression analysis.

### Problem Simplification:
- **Objective**: The primary goal is to use linear regression to predict the median housing price in different districts based on the provided features.
- **Regression Target**: The target variable is the 'median house value' for each district.
- **Predictors**: Key predictors include 'median income', 'total rooms', 'total bedrooms', 'population', and 'households', among others. We will explore how these factors influence housing prices, leveraging Gradient Descent to optimize our regression model.

This dataset not only allows us to apply linear regression but also to deeply understand the dynamics affecting housing prices in California, providing a practical framework for learning Gradient Descent.

## Algorithm Overview
Gradient Descent in Linear Regression is used to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function, which is crucial for achieving accurate predictions. Here’s a brief overview of the algorithm:

- **Initialization**: Start by initializing the regression coefficients (weights) to zero or small random values.
- **Cost Function**: Employ the MSE to quantify the error between predicted outputs and actual values.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Calculate the gradient of the MSE with respect to each coefficient.
- **Updating Coefficients**: Adjust the weights by moving in the direction opposite to the gradient, scaled by a learning rate.
- **Iteration**: Repeat the gradient calculation and weight updates until the MSE converges to a minimum or a specified number of iterations is reached.
- **Stochastic and Mini-batch Variants**: For larger datasets, use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Mini-batch Gradient Descent to enhance computational efficiency by approximating the gradient over smaller subsets of the data.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
**Advantages**:
- **Efficiency**: Handles large datasets well, especially when combined with its stochastic and mini-batch variants.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand, making it an excellent educational tool for learning optimization.
- **Flexibility**: Applicable to various types of regression tasks, including both linear and non-linear models.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Sensitivity to Learning Rate**: Incorrect settings can lead to non-convergence or excessive training time.
- **Local Minima and Saddle Points**: Can converge to local minima, particularly in more complex or non-convex cost landscapes.
- **Feature Scaling Requirement**: Requires standardized or normalized input features to perform well.
- **Initial Conditions**: The starting values of parameters can affect the outcome, especially in complex models.

## Implementation
In this project, we utilize the California Housing dataset, which includes features like median income, house age, average number of rooms, and geographic location, to predict median house values:

- **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**: Prepare the data by cleaning and normalizing features.
- **Implement the Gradient Descent Linear Regression Algorithm**: Code the algorithm from scratch to understand its mechanics.
- **Train the Regression Model**: Apply the model to the data and monitor the MSE reduction over iterations.
- **Evaluate the Model's Performance**: Use MSE and R-squared metrics to assess model accuracy.
- **Visualize Convergence**: Plot MSE against iterations to visualize how quickly and effectively the model converges.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Gradient Descent in optimizing linear regression models, a cornerstone technique in predictive analytics. This exploration into linear regression using the California Housing dataset offers practical insights into both the algorithm's capabilities and its limitations in real-world applications.

Feel free to explore the notebook, adjust the model's hyperparameters, and see firsthand how these changes influence the model’s learning and predictive accuracy.
