# Decision Trees and Regression Trees on the Titanic Dataset

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook delves into Decision Trees and Regression Trees, utilizing them to predict survival on the Titanic. Decision Trees are powerful algorithms that can be used for classification and regression tasks. They model decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.

## Algorithm

- **Decision Trees**:
  - Begin at the root node with the complete dataset.
  - Identify the most informative feature to split the data.
  - Split data recursively based on feature values.
  - Halt splitting when certain criteria are met, such as maximum depth or node purity.
  - Assign predictions to leaf nodes based on majority class or mean/median outcomes.

- **Adaptation to the Titanic Dataset**:
  - For classification, we predict passenger survival based on features like class, sex, and age.
  - The tree will reflect the probabilistic nature of survival, with decision paths leading to survival or non-survival leaf nodes.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**:
  - High interpretability, providing a clear visualization of the decision-making process.
  - Capable of handling both numerical and categorical data.
  - No assumption of feature independence, unlike some other algorithms.
  - No requirement for feature scaling.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can easily overfit to the training data, particularly if the tree is allowed to grow complex without pruning.
  - Small changes in the data can lead to different splits, making the model potentially unstable.
  - Decision trees are often biased towards classes with a larger number of instances.
  - They have limitations in capturing complex relationships due to their hierarchical nature.

## Implementation

- **Decision Tree for Classification**:
  - Employ the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers. Features include socioeconomic class, sex, age, and number of siblings/spouses aboard.

- **Regression Tree**:
  - While the Titanic dataset is typically used for classification, we can adapt it to a regression framework by predicting the age of passengers based on their socioeconomic class, number of relatives on board, fare paid, and cabin number.

## Conclusion

The notebook provides a practical application of Decision Trees and Regression Trees using the Titanic dataset, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. By predicting survival and passenger age, we demonstrate the versatility and interpretability of tree-based models. This application serves as a valuable exercise in understanding the dynamics of model decision-making and the implications of tree structure on predictive performance.
