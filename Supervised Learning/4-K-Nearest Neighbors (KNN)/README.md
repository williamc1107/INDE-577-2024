# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Algorithm

## Introduction

Welcome to the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Jupyter Notebook! This section demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a fundamental machine learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. We'll explore K-NN using the Wine Quality Dataset, which features physicochemical properties of wines alongside quality ratings.

## Algorithm Overview

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm operates on a straightforward principle: it predicts the label or value of a new data point by considering the 'k' closest data points from the training set. Hereâ€™s the general workflow:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a dataset where the outcomes are known.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance from the new, unlabeled data point to all points in the training dataset.
3. **Select K-Nearest Neighbors**: Identify the 'k' closest data points (neighbors).
4. **Prediction**:
   - **Classification**: Determine the most frequent label among the neighbors.
   - **Regression**: Compute the average or median value among the neighbors.

## Dataset

For this implementation, we utilize the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains several physicochemical properties of wine such as acidity, sulfur dioxide levels, sugar content, and alcohol content, along with a quality rating from 1 to 10. We will use these features to predict wine quality, which can be treated both as a classification (good vs. bad quality) and as a regression problem (predicting the exact quality score).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the data to ensure each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations.
2. **Model Implementation**: Apply the K-NN algorithm to classify wines as high or low quality and to predict their quality scores.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Regression**: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate prediction accuracy for quality scores.
   - **Classification**: Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Parameter Tuning**: Experiment with different values of 'k' to optimize model performance.

## Model Usage

- **Classification**: Classify wines as high or low quality based on their physicochemical properties.
- **Regression**: Predict the precise quality score for a given wine, providing more nuanced insights into wine characteristics.

## Choosing the Right 'k'

Selecting the appropriate 'k' is crucial as it can significantly impact the performance of the K-NN algorithm:

- A smaller 'k' can be overly sensitive to noise in the dataset, leading to overfitting.
- A larger 'k' generally reduces the effect of noise but can make the boundaries between different classes less distinct.

Optimal 'k' values are usually selected via cross-validation. Performance metrics are evaluated for a range of 'k' values, and the one that performs best on the validation set is chosen.
