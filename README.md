# INDE 577 Final Project - Data Science & Machine Learning
**Instructor:** Randy R. Davila

## Course Overview
This repository hosts the final project for INDE 577, a course focusing on Data Science and Machine Learning taught by Randy R. Davila. We've covered an extensive array of topics this semester, ranging from different types of learning algorithms to hands-on programming in Python and applying best practices in data science.

## Repository Organization
Our project repository is divided into four primary sections, each dedicated to specific areas of machine learning and containing comprehensive implementations and analysis:

### Supervised Learning
This segment explores a variety of supervised learning algorithms, each detailed within its own subdirectory:
- **The Perceptron**: A fundamental linear classifier that provides an introduction to neural network concepts.
- **Gradient Descent**: An essential optimization algorithm that iteratively reduces a cost function, crucial for many learning models.
- **Linear Regression**: A method used to predict continuous variables through the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: This technique handles binary and multiclass classification problems by estimating probabilities of different classes.
- **Neural Networks**: Concentrating on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), these networks are designed to model complex patterns in data.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method that assigns classifications based on the closest training examples in the data space.
- **Decision Trees**: These models are utilized for both classification and regression, making predictions based on learned decision rules.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Strategies like Random Forest that enhance model accuracy by combining the outputs from various models.

Each subdirectory includes comprehensive documentation, Jupyter notebooks for implementation, and discussions on the algorithms' applications and performance.

### Unsupervised Learning
In this section, we explore techniques used when labels are not available:
- **k-Means Clustering**: A method to group data points into clusters.
- **DBSCAN**: This stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Used for reducing dimensionality and extracting features.

### Reinforcement Learning
This segment provides a primer on reinforcement learning techniques:
- **Tabular Reinforcement Learning**: Basic concepts and implementations of reinforcement learning.

### Datasets
We utilize various datasets in our projects, including:
- **Titanic**: Details the demographics and passenger information of those aboard the tragic maiden voyage.


## Navigating the Repository
To review our work, please visit the folders corresponding to supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and datasets. Each directory includes detailed README.md files and Jupyter notebooks that showcase our practical implementations.

We appreciate your interest in our project. The detailed code explanations and analyses are located in the specific subdirectories, designed to provide insight and showcase our organization skills in data science implementations.
